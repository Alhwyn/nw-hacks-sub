Installing dependencies the legitimate way:
```bash
    # make sure your python versions are correct. I'd recommend using pyenv -> set python version to 3.12.9
    pip install playwright
    playwright install chromium # for unix users
```

To install dependencies (the noob way):

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.3.5. [Bun](https://bun.com) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
